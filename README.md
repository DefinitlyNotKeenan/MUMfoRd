If figuring things out scares you, you can basically follow these two guides: [Initial Setup](http://wiki.natenom.com/w/Mumble-Ruby_installation) and [Woah, Getting Advanced](http://wiki.natenom.com/w/Mumble-Ruby_music_bot_with_MPD).  
I'll get around to writing a guide that holds your hand through the process when I find some time, but until then just use your feminine intuition to get you through it.
